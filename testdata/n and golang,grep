./testdata/golang:4:Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms
./testdata/golang:5:make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked
./testdata/golang:6:machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program
./testdata/golang:8:garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast,
./testdata/grep:2:Grep was created by Ken Thompson as a standalone application adapted from the

./testdata/grep:10:specific modes of operation may be chosen with command line options.  A simple
./testdata/grep:34:The name of grep derives from a usage in the Unix text editor ed and related
